Thank you for installing fog!

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
If there's a metagem available for your cloud provider, e.g. `fog-aws`,
you should be using it instead of requiring the full fog collection to avoid
unnecessary dependencies.

'fog' should be required explicitly only if:
- The provider you use doesn't yet have a metagem available.
- You require Ruby 1.9.3 support.
